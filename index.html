    <!--Hi, I am the CEO of SixAlpha Technical Solutions.  I started SixAlpha to
    provide cutting edge service and products at value for federal government
    agencies, specifically the Department of Defense. You see I served in the
    Air Force for close to 21 years and watched as my branch of service
    continued to fall futher behind the private sector when it came to IT.
    Consequently, I watched as the Air Force threw money and people at outdated
    if not obsolete technical solutions hoping for a different result. There
    was not much I could do while active on active duty.

    I built SixAlpha Technical Solutions to solve the Department of Defense's
    most difficult technical problems by hiring, training, and retaining an
    expereinced and motivated staff. -->
